# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand the fundraising goal based on launch dates and goals for ddifferent campaigns. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I created the line charts, and pivot table to analyze the data. And the challenges I encounter include countifs function and pivot tables. I searched the online guidence, and worked with a tutor to solve these two problems. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the line chart, we can see that there is a significant increase form March to May, and a siginificant decrease happens between May and December.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When the goals for raising funding is betwen less than 1000 to 29999, there is a slowing trend. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The May is the best month to raise campaign. The December has the smallest campaign nunber. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The goal for raisng less than 1000 is the easiest to achive, a 80% success rate. However, ther is no chance to achieve the goal that raising funding between 45000 and 49999. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitations of this dataset include lack of location element. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create line charts for other Parent Category elements.Also, we can create pie and bar charts.
